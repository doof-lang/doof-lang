# Doof Type System Reference

## Primitive Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `byte` | 8-bit unsigned integer |
| `int` | 32-bit integer; default integer literal type |
| `long` | 64-bit integer |
| `float` | 32-bit floating point |
| `double` | 64-bit floating point; default decimal literal type |
| `string` | text |
| `char` | UTF-8 character |
| `bool` | boolean |
| `none` | unit type |
| `never` | uninhabited bottom type; terminating expressions |

`none` is both the unit/absence type and its sole value. `void` and `null` are
deprecated source aliases that canonicalize to `none` and produce replacement
warnings. JSON still spells the corresponding wire value `null`.

`never` has no values and is assignable to every type because evaluation never
reaches the value-consuming context. `T | never` normalizes to `T`. Functions
returning `never`, including `panic`, terminate their current control-flow path;
`never` is not JSON-serializable.

`string[index]` and `string.charAt(index)` return a `char`. Both forms panic
when the index is negative or outside the string's byte range. Convert the
result with `string(c)` when a one-character string is needed; `char` values
also work with equality checks and string concatenation.

`Range` is the built-in finite integer range type created by `a..b` and
`a..<b`. It can be stored, passed to functions, returned, and iterated with
`for of`; iteration yields `int`. Open-ended forms such as `5..` and `..<10`
are case-pattern-only. Range values expose `lowerBound` and exclusive
`upperBound` accessors, so `1..9` and `1..<10` both have `upperBound == 10`.
Ranges do not iterate downward; if `lowerBound > upperBound`, iteration
produces no values.

### Numeric Literals and Conversions

```doof
a := 42
b := 42L
c := 3.14
d := 3.14f

x: float := 3.14
n: long := 42
count := 30_000
```

Rules:

- `int` widens to `long`.
- `float` widens to `double`.
- Contextual literal narrowing applies when the target type is known.
- Numeric separators may appear between digits only.

Explicit numeric casts use function-call syntax:

```doof
small := int(large)
ratio := double(count)
codePoint := int('A')
```

`int(char)` returns the character's Unicode code point. Checked numeric narrowing uses `as` rather than cast syntax.

### String Conversion and Parse Helpers

```doof
label := string(42)
ok := string(true)

parsed := int.parse("42")
big := long.parse("9007199254740991")
ratio := double.parse("3.14")
```

`string(...)` accepts primitive values. Numeric parse helpers return `Result<T, ParseError>`.

## Generic Constraints

Generic type parameters can be constrained with `T: Constraint`. Union
constraints restrict type arguments to assignable members. `JsonSerializable` is
a compiler-known constraint-only intrinsic used for generic JSON helpers:

```doof
function decode<T: JsonSerializable>(json: JsonValue): Result<T, string> {
    return T.fromJsonValue(json)
}
```

## Type Inference

Doof uses single-step, context-aware inference.

```doof
names := ["Alice", "Bob"]
process([1, 2, 3])

empty: int[] = []
maybeName: string | none := none
```

Binding kind affects inference:

```doof
items := [1, 2, 3]
let buffer = [1, 2, 3]
readonly frozen = [1, 2, 3]
data := readonly [1, 2, 3]
```

Omitted named function and method return annotations mean `none`. Value-returning
named functions require an explicit return type; lambda returns may be inferred.

## Nullable Types

Nullability is explicit through unions.

```doof
name: string | none := none
value: int := none
```

The second line is a compile error.

Important rule: plain `if value != none` and `if value == none` do not change the static type. Use declaration-`else`, `case`, `as`, or postfix `!` for explicit narrowing.

```doof
if name != none {
    println(name!)
}

displayName := name ?? "Anonymous"
city := user?.address?.city
age := user!.age
```

## Union Types

```doof
type Value = int | string | bool
type Optional<T> = T | none
```

Discriminated unions usually use shared literal-valued fields.

```doof
class Success { kind: "Success"; value: int }
class Failure { kind: "Failure"; error: string }
type ParseResult = Success | Failure
```

Direct member access on a multi-member union is allowed only when every present
member has that field or method.

Error results are also ordinary unions: `Result<T, E>` is the canonical spelling
of `Success<T> | Failure<E>`. The intrinsic arms are valid standalone types, but
their payload members are intentionally not shared across the union.

## `JsonValue`

`JsonValue` is an exact recursive JSON carrier.

```doof
payload: JsonValue := { name: "Ada", scores: [1, 2, 3] }
```

Accepted shapes:

- `none` (serialized as JSON `null`)
- `bool`, `byte`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`
- `JsonValue[]`
- `Map<string, JsonValue>`
- unions composed from those cases

Rules:

- Contextual typing keeps literals ergonomic.
- Pre-built `int[]` or `Map<string, int>` values do not implicitly convert to `JsonValue`.
- `JsonObject` is a built-in alias for the exact object carrier type `Map<string, JsonValue>`.
- `long` values are preserved, including parsed JSON integers beyond `int` range.
- Object key insertion order is preserved for literals, formatting, and generated JSON methods.
- Assignments from `JsonValue[]` or `Map<string, JsonValue>` preserve shared-container reference semantics.

```doof
payload: JsonObject := { "name": "Ada" }
row: Map<string, JsonValue> := payload
```

## Enum Types

```doof
enum Direction { North, South, East, West }
enum HttpStatus { OK = 200, NotFound = 404 }
enum Color { Red = "RED", Green = "GREEN", Blue = "BLUE" }
```

Features:

```doof
let d: Direction = .East
d.name
HttpStatus.OK.value
Direction.values()
Direction.fromName("North")
HttpStatus.fromValue(200)
```

Dot-shorthand works when the target type is known.

## Collections

### Arrays

`T[]` is an ordered, reference-counted collection.

```doof
numbers := [1, 2, 3]
names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

Common APIs:

| Member | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `.length` | element count |
| `.push(value)` | mutable arrays only |
| `.reserve(capacity)` | mutable arrays only; reserves backing capacity without changing the element count |
| `.pop()` | `Result<T, string>` |
| `.contains(value)` | membership test |
| `.indexOf(value)` | first match or `-1` |
| `.some(pred)` | any match |
| `.every(pred)` | all match |
| `.filter(pred)` | preserves mutability |
| `.map(mapper)` | preserves mutability |
| `.slice(start, end)` | shallow slice |
| `.buildReadonly()` | mutable array only; move-drains into readonly and leaves the source empty |
| `.cloneMutable()` | shallow copy into a new mutable array |

`readonly T[]` and `ReadonlyArray<T>` are readonly collection types. Mutable and readonly arrays are distinct and do not implicitly convert between each other.

### Tuples

```doof
pair: (int, string) = (1, "one")
(id, label) := pair
```

Tuples are fixed-length and positionally destructured.

### Maps

```doof
scores: Map<string, int> = { "Alice": 100, "Bob": 95 }
ids: Map<long, string> = { 1L: "one", 2L: "two" }
frozenScores: ReadonlyMap := { "Alice": 100 }
```

Supported key types are `string`, `int`, `long`, `char`, `bool`, and enums.

Rules:

- Insertion order is preserved.
- Replacing an existing key does not move it.
- Deleting and reinserting appends it to the end.
- Empty maps require a full annotation.
- Omitted `Map` or `ReadonlyMap` type arguments work only for same-site non-empty homogeneous literals.

Common APIs:

| Member | Return | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.get(key)` | `Result<V, string>` | failure when missing |
| `.set(key, value)` | `none` | mutable maps only |
| `.has(key)` | `bool` | key test |
| `.delete(key)` | `none` | mutable maps only |
| `.keys()` | `K[]` | insertion order |
| `.values()` | `V[]` | insertion order |
| `.size` | `int` | entry count |
| `.buildReadonly()` | `ReadonlyMap<K, V>` | mutable maps only; move-drains and leaves the source empty |
| `.cloneMutable()` | `Map<K, V>` | shallow copy into a new mutable map |

Index access reads and writes directly. `ReadonlyMap<K, V>` is the readonly variant.

### Sets

```doof
unique: Set<int> = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
palette: Set<Color> = [Color.Red, Color.Blue]
frozenIds: ReadonlySet := [1, 2, 3]
view: readonly Set := [1, 2, 3]
readonly deepIds: Set = [1, 2, 3]
```

Supported element types are `string`, `int`, `long`, `char`, `bool`, and enums.

Rules:

- Insertion order is preserved.
- Duplicate inserts keep the first position.
- Empty literals require a full type annotation.
- Omitted `Set` or `ReadonlySet` type arguments work only for same-site non-empty homogeneous literals.
- `:=` is a shallow immutable binding, `readonly Set` is a readonly collection type, and a `readonly` declaration deep-freezes an inferred `Set` to `ReadonlySet<T>`.

Common APIs: `.size`, `.has()`, `.add()`, `.delete()`, `.values()`, `.buildReadonly()`, `.cloneMutable()`.

`.add()`, `.delete()`, and `.buildReadonly()` are mutable-set-only APIs. `buildReadonly()` move-drains the set into a readonly set and leaves the source empty. `cloneMutable()` works on both `Set<T>` and `ReadonlySet<T>` and returns a shallow mutable copy.

`Set<T>` and `ReadonlySet<T>` are distinct collection types.

### Streams

`Stream<T>` is a pull-based iteration surface with `next(): bool` and `value(): T`. Call `value()` only after `next()` returns `true`. Do not call `value()` multiple times per `next()`.

```doof
class Counter implements Stream<int> {
    current = 0
    end: int

    next(): bool => current < end
    value(): int {
        v := current
        current = current + 1
        return v
    }
}
```

`for value of someStream` works anywhere an iterable is expected.

## Class, Struct, and Interface Type Identity

- Classes and structs are nominal.
- Classes are reference types; structs are value types.
- Interfaces are structural.
- Interface types resolve against the closed world of matching classes at compile time.

```doof
interface Drawable { draw(canvas: Canvas): none }
```

Use classes for identity-rich domain types, structs for copied value data, and interfaces for structural contracts.
