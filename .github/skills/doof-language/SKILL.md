Use when writing .do files, designing Doof APIs, implementing Doof classes/functions, writing .test.do files, using assert or the doof test runner, handling errors with Result types, or working with Doof's module system, pattern matching, concurrency, or JSON serialization.

# Doof Language

Doof is a statically-typed language with familiar curly-brace syntax that transpiles to C++ with closed-world compilation. Files use the `.do` extension. Semicolons are optional and usually omitted.

Use this base file as the entry point. Load only the reference file that matches the task instead of carrying the whole language manual into context.

## Working Rules

- Prefer the focused reference files below over broad assumptions.
- When exact semantics matter, confirm them in `spec/*.md`.
- Keep code idiomatic: immutable by default, explicit types at boundaries, no JavaScript-style coercions.
- Use intrinsic `Success<T>` / `Failure<E>` arms and their `Result<T, E>` union alias with `case`, `try`, declaration-`else`, `as`, or `!` for fallible flows. Use `panic(...)` only for programmer errors.
- Plain `if value != none` checks do **not** narrow static types. Use explicit narrowing forms.
- Block-bodied non-`none` functions must return a value on every reachable path; `never` functions must terminate on every path.
- Classes and structs are nominal. Interfaces are structural.
- Prefer `readonly` for deeply immutable values and `:=` for immutable bindings with mutable interiors. `const` is deprecated and remains accepted temporarily with a warning.
- Prefer `std/<name>` packages before inventing utility modules.

## Quick Syntax

```doof
function main(): none {
    println("Hello, Doof!")
}

count := 1
let total = 0
readonly config = load()
readonly VERSION = "0.1"

result := try! loadConfig()
value := source as string else { return "" }
```

Key reminders:

- `main()` may return `none` or `int`, and may optionally accept `args: string[]`.
- Named calls use `callee{ ... }` with no whitespace before `{`.
- `if` expressions use `then`: `if ready then start() else wait()`.
- `for-of` evaluates its iterable once and retains returned temporaries through the loop.
- `/` requires a floating operand. Use `\` for integer division.
- `Map<K, V>` literals use `{ key: value }`. `Set<T>` literals use `[a, b, c]`.
- Mutable arrays support `.reserve(capacity)` to pre-size backing storage without changing their length.
- Runtime counters use `metricsIncrement(name: string, value: long)` and `metricsSnapshotPrometheus()`.
- Native free functions callable from actor-dispatched code require an explicit `import isolated function` contract.
- `none` is both the unit/absence type and its sole value. Use `T | none` for optional values; deprecated `void` and `null` aliases warn.
- `never` is the uninhabited bottom type. `panic(...)` and functions returning `never` terminate their control-flow path.

## Repo Anchors

- `spec/` is the authoritative language behavior reference.
- `tests/release-fixtures/` shows focused package and native-build layouts.
- `src/*.test.do` captures checker, parser, emitter, CLI, package, and platform edge cases.

## Practical Routing

- Writing a `.do` module from scratch: load [references/core-language.md](./references/core-language.md) and then whichever feature reference matches the code.
- Designing APIs with classes, interfaces, or metadata: load [references/classes-and-memory.md](./references/classes-and-memory.md) and [references/json-and-metadata.md](./references/json-and-metadata.md).
- Fixing type errors around unions, nullability, collections, or `JsonValue`: load [references/type-system.md](./references/type-system.md) and [references/error-handling.md](./references/error-handling.md).
- Working on imports, packages, or C++ bridge code: load [references/modules-and-interop.md](./references/modules-and-interop.md).
- Writing tests or mocks: load [references/stdlib-assert-and-testing.md](./references/stdlib-assert-and-testing.md).
